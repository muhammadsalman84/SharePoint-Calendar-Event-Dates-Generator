# SharePoint-Calendar-Event-Dates-Generator
SharePoint Calendar saves a event with recurrence rules as xml format. 
The following is an example for recurrence rule.



"<recurrence><rule><firstDayOfWeek>su</firstDayOfWeek><repeat><monthly monthFrequency="1" day="16" /></repeat><repeatForever>FALSE</repeatForever></rule></recurrence>"



If you are looking for a library that generates the same list of dates by looking into the recurrence xml then do check the datesgenerator.js.

This library can generate list of dates based on recurrence rules of the SharePoint event. 

Please do use this library and do contact me if you need any kind of help.
